### Let us discuss the Usage

**_var_** and **_let_** are basically used for creating a variable (Whose value can change during runtime!)

**_const_** as the name suggests is short for constant variable (whose value is fixed and won't change during runtime)

If you all are familiar with other languages like **(C, C++, Java)** you might notice that while allocating space to the variable we don't specify the Type of value which should be stored in that. This is Because JS is a weakly Typed Dynamic Language which simply means that the variables are not bounded towards a particular type/value (unless u declare it as _const_)

But Just to get Started with Here is a great quote By [Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) famously referred as Atwood's Law:

> “Any application that can be written in JavaScript,
> will eventually be written in JavaScript.”
